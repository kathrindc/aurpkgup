# aurpkgup - a minimal AUR helper

`aurpkgup` is pretty simple. It doesn't automate the build process, it doesn't download anything, it just lets you know if anything needs updating.

This script was created, because I just want to know if any of my AUR packages are out-of-date and I need to re-build them. I don't use a full-featured AUR wrapper like `yay` or `pikaur` because I just don't need it.
